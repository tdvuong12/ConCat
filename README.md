# HackerCat

TEAM NAME: HackerCat

APPLICATION NAME: ConCat

PROPOSED LEVEL OF ACHIEVEMENTS: Apollo 11 (final aim is Artemis depending on progression later on)

## AIMS:

We hope to create an assistant software for Android that assist in launching
another application or automatically perform repeated tasks upon
signature, through an intermediate overlaying widget on the homescreen,
by interacting or swiping the widget in many different ways.
Scope: Utility app launcher specifically for Android with extensions.

## MOTIVATIONS:
We wish to create a product that is useful in every aspect of our daily life,
specifically in reducing the usage time of handphone for various daily tasks
or to reduce operation time in launching certain applications on our phone.
In explaining the rationale of our application, time has become more
precious nowadays and we are becoming less patient when we perform
certain actions through our phone. Especially those actions that require a
large amount of time to do, actions that are repeated everyday, or actions
that are tedious in many ways. Some examples would be to declare
temperature on UniVus, replying to daily emails and messages, or setting
the alarm clock every night. Most of us tend to be forgetful or grow bored
with doing these tasks daily, but they are important to the operations of our
lives.

This prompts us an important question: What if we can find a shortcut to all
these tasks? What if we can perform an action one time, then record it,
then we can repeat it later on? Just like playing a Youtube Video? In that,
to perform these tasks the second time onwards, the only thing we need to
do is press and swipe a button on the screen that is already there? Is there
any simple and quick way to ease our lives?

## USERS STORIES
* Imagine an NUS student who gets tired of declaring temperature
everyday and decided that he wants to spend the least time possible
on it. He can simply declare the temperature one time, then record
through our application. The next time he has to declare temperature
on UniVus, he only needs to swipe a button upwards or downwards.
* Imagine a workman who needs to get up early at 7AM every morning
to go to work, but he becomes very tired at night when he returns
home and he does not have the energy to set the alarm clock. He can
simply rest a bit, set the alarm clock one time on the weekend to 7AM
every weekday morning, then let us do the rest for him.

## CORE FEATURES
Our assistant software will include these features and designs:
* Normal Android Mobile App icon, setting, and front-end design.
* A button/widget with customary graphic design overlaying the user’s
home screen and can be moved to different locations at the home
screen. The default design of the widget should be a cat as our app is
named “ConCat”. To specify further, the widget is similar to Facebook
Messenger's Bubble Head.
* Customary options on how different swiping directions of the floating
widget will result in different apps being launched or different tasks
being completed. There will be a default setting with 4 cardinal
directions launching 4 different applications.
* Record-and-replay features – depending on the user’s customary
choice, swiping the widget will also allow our application to perform
and repeat multi-stage tasks upon triggering the floating widget. In
doing so, we will need permission to access user’s data and other
applications on the phone.

## Proposed restructuring of README and Milestone report:

* Motivation and Purpose
* Aim
* User stories (continued) - need at least 4
* Complete set of features and explanation - tools used during the process of development
  1. Widget
  2. App launcher
* Explaining user flow and reference
